# Data Structures Overview

## What is a Data Structure?
In essence, a data structure is a way to organize data such that it can be
utilized as efficiently as possible. This data may include integers, strings, or any
other form of data that can be organized and referenced. Although a data structure
is a form of storing data, **how** it is being organized remains as the core of the data
structure. Data structures are vastly used in industries in order to sort and organize
large amounts of data, also known as *big data*. Efficient data structures are
essential for big data analysis because without them, it would take an insane
amount of time to find and process data.

The point of a data structure is to be able to access and manipulate the
data as easily as possible. Organizing the data is necessary in order to perform a
number of operations on it, such as traversing, searching, and sorting. Thus,
actions such as inserting and deleting need to be as concise as possible. Data
structures are designed such that manipulation of the data can be as systematic as
possible, and thus different variations have been developed, each with efficiency in
mind. Efficiency is the key to successful development.


## Why do they matter?

Imagine if you need to organize 50,000,000 word documents and tag them,
such that any one of them can be referenced and pulled as quickly as possible.
The documents can be distinguished by different characteristics such as name,
content, or topic. It is up to the programmer to decide how the most efficient way
to tag and organize the books. Lets imagine he/she organizes it by name
alphabetically, and we are trying to find a book that starts with the letter J. One
way to find the document is to go one by one, alphabetically until the name is
found (A, B, C, etc). We would need to pass 10 letters before, each possibly
containing 2 million books. However, if we index the first letter, such that we can
automatically jump to the letter J and search in that range. Although not the most
efficient way, it is an example of how efficiency is essential in any project.

## What can I learn?

There is a plethora of data structures used in the industry for different types
of data such as lists, trees, and many others, each of which are used to keep
projects as effective as possible. Although not necessary to know every single data
structure in existence, it is useful to know the basics of each and which to
implement in a given scenario. Tech interviews will often assess your knowledge of
your data structures, so it is important to have a solid foundation in this topic. In
this tutorial series we will go through each major data structure and break down its
implementation, highlighting its key features and performance drawbacks.
